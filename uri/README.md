# What is Mango URI?

Mango URI promotes distributed data linking in a multi-cluster. 

# Why do we care?

When managing data at the cloud level, especially between multiple connected clouds, it's not possible to replicate and synchronize every piece of data. In these cases, it's still important to link data between the clouds and be able to resolve the links. The URI is the standard contract by which services can honor a linked request for data.
